# JavaScript Loops Activity

## Activity 1 - Guessing Game

Activiy should be done in groups, size 2-4. 

### Objective

Create an app that gives the user 5 tries to guess a random number between 1 - 20.

Write out the logic to accomplish this first. This will be your game plan for writing the solution with code

Each step should be completed by a new group member as the rest of the group helps

### Step 1

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Add all members as contributers to the new fork
3. All memebers should **clone** the new forked repository to their projects folder
4. Create an HTML file for this app (index.html is fine)
5. Add the global structure into the HTML file
6. Create a *js* folder
7. Create a JavaScript file in this folder. Name it whatever you want
8. In the HTML file, connect the newly create JavaScript file
9. Preview in a web browser to confirm page is setup correctly
10. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
11. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository

### Step 2
Create an application that generates a random number between 1 - 100. Asks the user to guess that number.


### Step 3

Give the user 5 tries to guess.

### Step 4

Message to the user if their guesses are too high or low

## Activity 2 - Triangles

Activiy should be done in groups, size 2-4. 

### Objective

Ask the user for a number and create a triangle from a text character


Write out the logic to accomplish this first. This will be your game plan for writing the solution with code

Each step should be completed by a new group member as the rest of the group helps

### Step 1

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Add all members as contributers to the new fork
3. All memebers should **clone** the new forked repository to their projects folder
4. Create an HTML file for this app (index.html is fine)
5. Add the global structure into the HTML file
6. Create a *js* folder
7. Create a JavaScript file in this folder. Name it whatever you want
8. In the HTML file, connect the newly create JavaScript file
9. Preview in a web browser to confirm page is setup correctly
10. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
11. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository

### Step 2

Ask the user to enter a number. Validate if the input is a number. If they don't enter a valid value, ask the user to input a number again 

*Hint: Research typeOf*


### Step 3

Counting from 1 to the users input, print to the web page a line of characters matching the current count

*Example*

```
// User enters 5
*
**
***
****
*****
```

### Step 4

Display the triange fliped horizontally

*Example*

```
// User enters 5
*****
****
***
**
*
```

## Activity 3 - ChimiChangas 2!

Activiy should be done in groups, size 2-4. 

### Objective

Create an application that asks the user to enter a number. If the number is divisible by 3,  alert 'chimi'. If the number is divisible by 5, alert 'changas'. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, alert 'chimichangas!`

Write out the logic to accomplish this first. This will be your game plan for writing the solution with code

Each step should be completed by a new group member as the rest of the group helps

### Step 1

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Add all members as contributers to the new fork
3. All memebers should **clone** the new forked repository to their projects folder
4. Create an HTML file for this app (index.html is fine)
5. Add the global structure into the HTML file
6. Create a *js* folder
7. Create a JavaScript file in this folder. Name it whatever you want
8. In the HTML file, connect the newly create JavaScript file
9. Preview in a web browser to confirm page is setup correctly
10. Use git to add/commit/push the changes
11. All members use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote repository

### Step 2

Ask the user to enter a number. Validate if the input is a number. If they don't enter a valid value, ask the user to input a number again 


### Step 3

Using `document.getElementById` to display output, count from 1 to the value entered by the user.

Every number should have it's own line

```
1
2
3
...
```

### Step 4

Replace numbers divisible by 3 with *chimi*

Replace numbers divisible by 5 with *changas*

Replace numbers divisible by 3 and 5 with *chimichangas!*
